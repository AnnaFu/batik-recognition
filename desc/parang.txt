Parang
/Batik Parang is one of the oldest batik motif in Indonesia. Created by the founder of the Mataram royal palace, so this motif becomes the main guide in determining the degree of nobility of a person.
/The Parang was once one of the ¡°Larangan¡± designs, a proscribed and prohibited motif reserved for the royal courts of Yogyakarta and Surakarta, some Parang were worn exclusively by the King. Traditional Parang from Yogyakarta consisted of slanting parallel rows of dagger- like segments, arranged repetitively on contrasting colours of cream white, brown and indigo. It was known as the sword pattern or the tongue of fire and was related to the ¡°Keris¡± ceremonial dagger, promoting strength, power, authority and speed. 
/The characteristic curved lines of Parang could also be translated as waves in the sea, symbolising the power and greatness of nature. Legends emphasised the supernatural power of the Parang to bring victory in war, protection and healing of the sick. The unbroken arrangement of the S intertwining motif symbolizes continuity. The basic form of the letter S is taken from the ocean waves that describe a spirit that never goes out.
